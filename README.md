Capsule is a photo archiving app that allows the user to store their photos in a meaningful way. When a user creates a capsule, they are storing a timeline of memories for posterity to be opened at a later date, or to be sent as gifts to loved ones.

Capsule is for anyone who wants to create a time capsule of history with their photos.

Capsule is best used by individuals who want to have a documented and meaningful avenue to store and build a life long gift of memories that will continue from person to person, form parent to child, from friend to friend and so on and so on. The old photo album stuffed in the closet is over and done with. It's one think to store photos in a cloud, but what capsule allows you to do is make each person in your life special, by creating their very own time capsule.

The user will know they have something meaningful in our app when they see their created time capsule grow from a single picture to an impressive archived display of life.

This app will allow the user to not only take photos and store them in a capsule of their choosing, but will also allow the user to send any capsule as a gift to loved ones. Each capsule can be set to a certain time frame. Upon that time the capsule will be opened and history will pore out revealing things that have bee forgotten.

Because of the purpose of this application, there can be some drawbacks. For example the user can forget about the app and start using something else. The user could also not have the patience to continue to add photos because of the time set on the capsule. The user can also stop using the app because of monetary obligations. Obligations which have not been defined as of yet by the developers.

Our users do not have this product as of yet due to the continued development process which has not been completed.

Our product will be ready for based on the MVP (minimal viable product) when the application can take a photo, store it in a created capsule with time stamp, and then retrieved again by the user.
